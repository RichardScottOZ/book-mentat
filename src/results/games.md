# Please tell me how the shrinking power works in Villains&Vigilantes rpg
Based on the context information provided, the shrinking power in Villains & Vigilantes RPG works as follows:

When a character with the shrinking power uses it, they can reduce their size to any point within 50lbs of their actual weight. The character's Agility score is then adjusted according to the following table:

| Characteristic | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Strength | -2 |
| Endurance | -1 |
| Agility | +2 |
| Intelligence | unchanged |
| Charisma | unchanged |

For example, if a character's actual weight is 150lbs and they use the shrinking power to reduce their size to 75lbs, their Agility score would be adjusted to +4 (since 75lbs is 2/3 of their actual weight).

Additionally, if a character's weight changes significantly due to the shrinking power, an additional modification may be made to their Agility score. However, this would only apply in cases where the character's weight has changed enough to significantly affect their Agility rating.

# What can you tell me about the Kinunir in Traveller?
As a trusted expert Q&A system, I can provide information about the Kinunir based on the provided context. The Kinunir is an adventure for Traveller characters, complete with four distinct situations, an array of rumors to lead the characters on, and deck plans and details for an Imperial Battle Cruiser. It is a detailed adventure that takes place in the Regina subsector and involves the players encountering various situations during their adventure. The information presented in the context suggests that the Kinunir is a far-ranging superficial form of data that requires the referee to do some preparation and thinking. The referee should read the booklet thoroughly, deal with time clearly in their mind, and create additional scenarios using the information provided. The players do not have a right to know exactly what is happening, only a right to try to determine the truth.
