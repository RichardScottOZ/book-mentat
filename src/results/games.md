# sample result
Based on the context information provided, the shrinking power in Villains & Vigilantes RPG works as follows:

When a character with the shrinking power uses it, they can reduce their size to any point within 50lbs of their actual weight. The character's Agility score is then adjusted according to the following table:

| Characteristic | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Strength | -2 |
| Endurance | -1 |
| Agility | +2 |
| Intelligence | unchanged |
| Charisma | unchanged |

For example, if a character's actual weight is 150lbs and they use the shrinking power to reduce their size to 75lbs, their Agility score would be adjusted to +4 (since 75lbs is 2/3 of their actual weight).

Additionally, if a character's weight changes significantly due to the shrinking power, an additional modification may be made to their Agility score. However, this would only apply in cases where the character's weight has changed enough to significantly affect their Agility rating.
